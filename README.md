This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# Stuff scope working flow..

Got it ‚Äî thanks for clarifying! Since the MVP is a **web app** (not native mobile), where users receive a **link via SMS/WhatsApp/email** to start scanning, here‚Äôs a **refined one-liner step flow** that matches your plan:

1. **Get a link** ‚Üí receive StuffScope scan link on your phone or email.
2. **Open in browser** ‚Üí no download, works instantly.
3. **Start scan** ‚Üí use your phone camera to capture a room.
4. **AI processes** ‚Üí items detected and auto-categorized.
5. **Add details** ‚Üí edit, confirm, or adjust if needed.
6. **Save & export** ‚Üí generate report, CSV, or keep in cloud dashboard.

This way, it feels **lightweight, web-first, frictionless** (no app store needed).

üëâ Do you want me to now **write this flow as a ‚ÄúHow it Works‚Äù section** for your landing page (with short text + small visual cues for each step)?
