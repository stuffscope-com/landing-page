## 1. Product Shot Prompt

> A clean, minimalist **web app interface** displayed on a modern smartphone screen, light-mode only. The screen shows **StuffScope**, a belongings inventory tool: a simple dashboard with categories like *Furniture, Electronics, Appliances, Collectibles*. The UI is professional, uncluttered, with white background, subtle gray cards, and a primary blue accent for buttons. Photorealistic product mockup, soft shadows, flat lay style with a single phone device in focus.

## 2. Workflow Image Prompt (Step-by-Step Screens)

> A **series of six smartphone screens** in a horizontal workflow illustration, each showing a key StuffScope step in a modern, minimal style:
>
> 1. Receiving a link message (SMS preview with “Start Scan”).
> 2. Opening StuffScope web app in a browser.
> 3. Phone camera view scanning a room.
> 4. AI detecting and auto-categorizing items into cards.
> 5. User editing details (typing or toggling categories).
> 6. Export screen with options: CSV, PDF, Dashboard.
>    Design in a clean, professional UI style, light background, blue accent, minimal illustration or semi-realistic mockup. Optimized for **mobile-friendly SaaS look**.

## 3. Feature Highlight Prompt

> A modern, minimal **concept illustration** showing five feature cards side by side: *One-tap scanning*, *Automatic categorization*, *Value estimates*, *Flexible exports*, *Cloud backup*. Each card has a simple icon (camera, folder, dollar sign, download, cloud) with a short label below. Use subtle gradients, light backgrounds, professional blue/gray palette, and flat modern style.

## 4. “How It Works” Infographic Prompt

> A clean infographic in light mode with **six steps** connected in a linear timeline: *Get a link → Open in browser → Start scan → AI processes → Add details → Save & export.* Each step has a small mobile mockup icon above it and a short caption. Use minimalist colors (white, gray, blue), rounded shapes, and a professional SaaS feel.

⚡ These prompts cover **hero product shot, workflow demo, feature highlights, and step-by-step infographic**.

Would you like me to **bundle these into a single “image pack brief”** (so you can generate them all at once with consistent style), or keep them as separate standalone prompts?
