Ahh, got it — you want to create a **product demo** (video-style walkthrough) using **AI-generated images + motion**, without having the full product built yet. That’s perfect for StuffScope’s MVP pitch or landing page. Here’s a **clear step-by-step workflow** using mostly free tools:

---

## 🔹 Step 1. Define the Demo Storyboard

Before generating assets, decide what you want to show in the video. For StuffScope MVP, a simple **6-step flow** works:

1. User gets a link on phone.
2. Opens StuffScope in browser.
3. Starts scanning a room.
4. AI detects and categorizes items.
5. User reviews/edits details.
6. Exports to report/CSV/dashboard.

👉 Each step = **1 key screen or scene** you’ll design.

---

## 🔹 Step 2. Generate Screens / Mockups (AI Images)

**Tools:** Leonardo.AI (free credits), SeaArt.AI, Canva Free, or Figma with Uizard plugin.

**Process:**

1. Use prompts like:
   *“A clean, minimalist web app UI on a smartphone, showing a simple scanning screen with camera preview, white background, professional blue accents, light mode.”*
2. Generate **one screen per storyboard step**.
3. Export them as **PNG images**.
4. Optionally refine in **Canva** (add labels like “Step 3: Scan your room”).

---

## 🔹 Step 3. Add Device Mockups (Optional, for realism)

* Drop your UI screenshots into **Canva’s phone mockups** (free library).
* This makes it look like a real phone product demo.
* Keep background **clean, light, minimal** to stay professional.

---

## 🔹 Step 4. Animate Into a Workflow Video

**Tools:**

* **Canva Free/Pro** → simple animations, slide transitions, export MP4.
* **Runway ML (free credits)** → AI video-to-video motion (turn static into animated).
* **Pika Labs** → generate motion from stills (short clips).

**Process:**

1. Import all your generated images/screens into Canva.
2. Arrange in sequence (Step 1 → Step 6).
3. Add **subtle motion** (fade-in, slide-up, pan).
4. Add captions for each step (“AI categorizes items automatically”).
5. Export as a short MP4 (30–45 seconds).

---

## 🔹 Step 5. Optional AI Voiceover or Music

* Use **ElevenLabs free tier** or **Play.ht** for realistic voiceover:
  *“With StuffScope, you can scan, organize, and protect your belongings in minutes.”*
* Add **royalty-free background music** from YouTube Audio Library or Pixabay.
* Sync inside Canva or CapCut (free).

---

## 🔹 Step 6. Export & Use

* Export final MP4 in **1080p**.
* Use on landing page Hero section or LinkedIn posts.
* Also cut shorter (10–15 sec) versions for social shares.

---

✅ **Result:** You’ll have a **product demo video** that looks like a real web app walkthrough, entirely built from AI-generated screens + animations, without coding the app yet.

Do you want me to **write exact image prompts for each of the 6 storyboard steps** so you can generate all screens in consistent style?
