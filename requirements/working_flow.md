Got it — thanks for clarifying! Since the MVP is a **web app** (not native mobile), where users receive a **link via SMS/WhatsApp/email** to start scanning, here’s a **refined one-liner step flow** that matches your plan:

1. **Get a link** → receive StuffScope scan link on your phone or email.
2. **Open in browser** → no download, works instantly.
3. **Start scan** → use your phone camera to capture a room.
4. **AI processes** → items detected and auto-categorized.
5. **Add details** → edit, confirm, or adjust if needed.
6. **Save & export** → generate report, CSV, or keep in cloud dashboard.

This way, it feels **lightweight, web-first, frictionless** (no app store needed).

👉 **please write this flow as a “How it Works” section** forlanding page (with short text + small visual cues for each step)?
